```curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/books'```
- GET by id: 
```curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/books/1'```
- POST book: 
```curl --location 'http://localhost:3000/books' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{ "title":"The beginning after the end", "author":"turtleme", "genre":"action" }'```
- PUT update book's details: 
```curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:3000/books/2' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{ "genre":"fantasy" }'```

```curl --location --request PATCH 'http://localhost:3000/books/1/borrow'```
- DELETE book by id: 
```curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:3000/books/2'```
